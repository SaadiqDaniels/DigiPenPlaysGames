A simple Twitch Plays Pokemon clone

### How to get ready to run this
1. Have a python interpreter
2. Install the discord pip package `py -m pip install discord`
3. Install the keyboard pip package `py -m pip install keyboard`
4. Make a discord bot and get the bot token
5. Make a discord server and invite the bot to it
6. Make a channel for people to type in (also, it might be a good idea to 
remove spam protection for that channel and mute it by default)

### How to run this code
1. Get your discord bot key
2. Get the name of the channel where you want the messages to be input
3. Pass both values to the script using this format 
`python.exe` `main.py` `token` `text channel name`
4. Have fun

### Games I recommend
1. [Tetris](https://tetr.io/)

#### Note
The keyboard commands get sent to your focused application in your operating
system. So the host cannot use the same computer to run the game/python code
and also participate.

Additionally the host cannot also use the same discord account to stream the 
game on one computer and also join a voice chat using a second. So you may 
have to use one computer to stream the game, run the python code, listen, and
chat in a discord call. And then use the second computer to just type commands
for the bot. This is only a problem for the host.
